# Djando Class-based and Generic Views Lab Project

## Overview
In this lab, I was taught to incorporate features into an app by utilizing class-based and generic views in Django. The focus was on examining the differences between function-based views and class-based views, and understanding how the latter streamline the development process.

## Features Demonstrated
- Utilization of class-based views (CBVs) such as ListView, DetailView, and View.
- Comparison between function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views.
- Implementation of common tasks using generic views to reduce workload.
- Handling POST requests and processing form data in class-based views.

## Contents
The project contains the following code snippets and features:
- Class-based views for displaying a list of courses and their details.
- Handling course enrollment using a View subclass.
- Commented-out function-based views for reference and comparison.
- Integration of models and views for seamless app functionality.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Ensure Django is installed (`pip install django`).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`.
4. Access the application through the provided URLs.

## Additional Notes
By examining the commented-out function-based views and comparing them to the built-in generic views, I was able to observe how class-based views streamline the development process by abstracting common tasks in superclasses. This abstraction helps reduce the workload and simplifies the implementation of app features.
